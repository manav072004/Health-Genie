# HealthGenie
Inspiration
I was inspired to create a web-based health app because I wanted to make healthcare more accessible to everyone. I noticed that many people struggle to access healthcare services, especially in remote or underserved areas. With a web-based health app, I could make healthcare more accessible to a wider audience. Additionally, I wanted to reduce the frustration of long wait times at the doctor's office. By incorporating an AI chatbot, I could provide quick answers to common health questions and help reduce wait times. I also wanted to enhance the patient experience by offering a pill reminder and SMS notifications. I believe that this will help patients stay on top of their medications and improve their overall health outcomes. Furthermore, I was excited about the opportunity to utilize cutting-edge technology, such as AI, in the healthcare industry. By creating a health app that incorporates these technologies, I aim to make a positive impact on people's lives and improve healthcare access and outcomes.

What it does
The app requires user to sign in to access various Health and wellness features. Some features include creating appointments to certified doctors where the patient will later recieve email confirmation of an appointment. Furthermore, we have a ai chatbot using openAI API to act as a helper that answers patient medical questions. We also have a pill-reminder feature that reminds patients through sms notifcation when to take their pills.

How we built it
We built the app using JavaScript, HTML, CSS. We used HTML and CSS to create the styling and layout of the website. We further used JavaScript to manipulate user sign in data. To store and save user emails, we used Firebase. We also used Open AI's API to implement the helper chatbot that answer questions. To send sms notifications, we used Twilio.

Challenges we ran into
Some challenges that we ran through was implementing the chatgpt API and the Twilio API into our code. We had some struggle in sending the SMS notifcation and implementing a interactive chatgpt into Node.js

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some accomplishments that we are proud of were solving the issues on chatgpt API and Twilio SMS notifications issues. Furthermore, we created a sophisticated log in system that requires users to verify their new accounts. Additionally, we are proud of the styling of our site and the overall look of our website.

What we learned
This hackathon has taught us more about new API's like chatgpt API, Twilio, and Firebase. We further increased our skills in UI and JavaScript. We also learned to efficiently manage our time and work together as a team to accomplish our goals.

What's next for Health Genie
Health Genie will further expand providing more features that can allow users to use the app to connect to wellness exercises like yoga and bodyweight exercise. Furthermore, it will help patients by providing them with reminders to where they kept their important items through SMS notifcaiton.
